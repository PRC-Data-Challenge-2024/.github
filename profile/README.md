# PRC Data Challenge 2024

Provide 369013 flights flown all over Europe in 2022 to 132 teams (261 individual) and they do magic in building models to estimate the Actual Takeoff Weight (ATOW)!

This organization collects material related to the [2024 PRC Data Challenge](https://ansperformance.eu/study/data-challenge/).

We forked the repos from the team's original (GPLv3) pubic repositories in order to trace the genealogy (and mantain attribution).

We used these forks (up to latest commit before the challenge deadline) to evaluate the submissions for the final prize.
We think that these repos could also be a trampoline for further extensions and study material for other interested groups or indivisuals.

Here you can find [the slides (PDF)](PRC_Data_Challenge_2024.pdf) of the outcome of the PRC Data Challenge 2024 presented on Fri 8th Nov at the 12th OpenSky Sympoium in Hamburg, Germany.
