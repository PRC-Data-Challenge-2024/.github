# PRC Data Challenge 2024

This organization collects material related to the [2024 PRC Data Challenge](https://ansperformance.eu/study/data-challenge/).

We forked the repos from the team's original pubic repositories in order to trace the genealogy (and mantain attribution).

We use these forks (up to latest commit before the challenge deadline) to evaluate for the final prize.
We think that these repos could also be a trampoline for further extensions and study material for others.

Here you can find [the slides](PRC_Data_Challenge_2024.pdf) of the outcome of the PRC Data Challenge 2024 presented on Fri 8th Nov at the 12th OpenSky Sympoium in Hamburg, Germany.
